---

Barodoc is a documentation framework built on Astro, designed to create beautiful documentation sites with minimal configuration.

## Features

- **MDX Support** - Write documentation in MDX with full component support
- **Dark Mode** - Built-in dark mode with system preference detection
- **Search** - Full-text search powered by Pagefind
- **i18n** - Multi-language support out of the box
- **Static** - Deploy anywhere as static files (GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify)

## Quick Example

```bash
pnpm create barodoc my-docs
cd my-docs
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your documentation site is now running at `http://localhost:4321`.

## Architecture

Barodoc consists of two main packages:

- `@barodoc/core` - Astro integration handling config, routing, and i18n
- `@barodoc/theme-docs` - Documentation theme with all UI components

This separation allows for future theme extensibility while keeping the core functionality stable.
