title: Content Structure
description: Where to put content and how URLs are built
---

Barodoc content lives under `src/content/docs/`. Each locale has its own folder; the folder structure becomes the URL path.

## Directory layout

```
src/content/docs/
├── en/                        # Default locale (e.g. /docs/...)
│   ├── introduction.mdx       # /docs/introduction
│   ├── quickstart.mdx         # /docs/quickstart
│   └── guides/
│       ├── installation.mdx   # /docs/guides/installation
│       └── deployment.mdx     # /docs/guides/deployment
└── ko/                        # Second locale (e.g. /ko/docs/...)
    ├── introduction.mdx       # /ko/docs/introduction
    └── guides/
        └── installation.mdx   # /ko/docs/guides/installation
```

- **Locale folder** (`en`, `ko`, etc.) is required. Even single-language docs use one (e.g. `en/`).
- **File path = URL slug**: `guides/installation.mdx` → `/docs/guides/installation` (or `/[locale]/docs/guides/installation` when i18n is used).
- Use **lowercase** and **hyphens** for file names (e.g. `code-group.mdx`, not `CodeGroup.mdx`) so URLs stay consistent.

## Page slug and navigation

In `barodoc.config.json`, `navigation.pages` use the **slug without locale and without `.mdx`**:

- File: `src/content/docs/en/guides/installation.mdx`  
  Slug for nav: `guides/installation`
- File: `src/content/docs/en/components/accordion.mdx`  
  Slug for nav: `components/accordion`

The same slug is used for all locales; each locale has its own file under its folder (`en/...`, `ko/...`).

## Frontmatter

Every doc page should have a title (and optionally description) in frontmatter:

```mdx
---
title: Installation
description: Install Barodoc in your project
---

# Installation
...
```

- **title** – Shown in the browser tab, sidebar, and meta.
- **description** – Used for meta description and previews.

## MDX and components

- You can use **Markdown** and **MDX** (JSX in Markdown).
- To use theme components (Tabs, Accordion, ParamField, etc.), import them at the top of the file. In development, use the component path (e.g. `@barodoc/theme-docs/components/mdx/DocAccordion.tsx`). See [Components](/docs/components/accordion) for examples.
- Interactive components need the `client:load` directive so they hydrate on the client (e.g. `<Tabs client:load ... />`).

## Static assets

Put images and other static files in **`public/`**. Reference them by path from the site root:

- `public/logo.svg` → `/logo.svg`
- `public/images/diagram.png` → `/images/diagram.png`

Use these paths in `barodoc.config.json` (e.g. `logo`, `favicon`) and in MDX/Markdown (e.g. `![alt](/images/diagram.png)`).
