description: Deploy your Barodoc site to static hosting
---

Barodoc builds to a static site. Deploy the `dist/` folder to any static host.

## Build

```bash
pnpm build
```

Output is in `dist/`. After build, search index is generated with Pagefind (`pagefind --site dist` if configured).

## Vercel

1. Push your repo to GitHub.
2. In [Vercel](https://vercel.com), import the repository.
3. **Build command:** `pnpm build` (or `npm run build`)
4. **Output directory:** `dist`
5. **Install command:** `pnpm install` (or `npm install`)
6. Deploy.

No extra config needed. Vercel detects Node and runs the build.

## Netlify

1. Push your repo to GitHub.
2. In [Netlify](https://netlify.com), add new site from Git.
3. **Build command:** `pnpm build`
4. **Publish directory:** `dist`
5. **Base directory:** leave empty (or set if the docs app is in a subdirectory, e.g. `docs`)
6. Deploy.

Optional: add `netlify.toml` in the project root:

```toml
[build]
  command = "pnpm build"
  publish = "dist"
```

## GitHub Pages

1. In repo **Settings → Pages**, set source to **GitHub Actions**.
2. Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4
        with:
          version: 9
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
          cache: "pnpm"
      - run: pnpm install
      - run: pnpm build
      - uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@3
        with:
          path: dist

  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@4
```

3. Push; the workflow will build and deploy. Set **Pages** URL in repo settings if needed (e.g. `username.github.io/repo-name` for project sites).

## Cloudflare Pages

1. Push your repo to GitHub.
2. In [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com), create a project from Git.
3. **Build command:** `pnpm build`
4. **Build output directory:** `dist`
5. **Root directory:** leave empty (or `docs` if the app lives in a subdirectory)
6. **Node version:** 20 (in **Environment variables**: `NODE_VERSION` = `20`)
7. Deploy.

## Environment and Node Version

- Use **Node 20+** on the host (or set `NODE_VERSION` / `ENGINE_NODE` where supported).
- No server-side runtime or env vars are required at build time unless your content or config reads them.
